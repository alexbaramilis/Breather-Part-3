# Building Breather (Part 3)

Breather is an open-source iOS app that shows the weather, air pollution and asthma conditions around you.
I'm building the app and writing a Medium series to raise awareness about air pollution 
and practice some of the latest knowledge I gain about iOS, Swift and programming.

This repo accompanies the Medium articles:
- [Part 3: Managing networking with RxMoya and handling errors with RxSwiftâ€™s retry and materialize.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-3-managing-networking-with-rxmoya-and-handling-errors-with-rxswifts-c300648858b8)
